## $\color{lightseagreen}{Technologies}$

---


* To bring this project together, we used the following technologies:

* Vanilla $\color {lightsalmon} {JavaScript}$, $\color {lightsalmon} {CSS}$, and $\color {lightsalmon}{HTML}$ for the core development.

* $\color {lightsalmon} {Visual\ Studio\ Code}$ as the primary integrated development environment (IDE).

## $\color{lightseagreen}{File\ Structure}$


---


* The $\color {lightsalmon}{root\ directory}$ contains all the $\color{lightsalmon}{HTML\ files}$, which serve as the different pages of the eye clinic information system.

* Inside the root directory, you will find a $\color{lightsalmon} {'src' folder}$. This folder contains the $\color {lightsalmon}{source\: code}$ and additional resources for the project.

* Within the $\color {lightsalmon}{'src' folder}$, there is a $\color{lightsalmon}{'styles'\ directory}$. This directory houses $\color{lightsalmon}{all\ the\ CSS\ files}$ that define the styling and layout of the web pages.

* The $\color{lightsalmon}{'pages' directory}$, also located within the $\color{lightsalmon}{'src' folder}$, contains the $\color{lightsalmon}{JavaScript\ files}$ responsible for implementing the $\color {lightsalmon}{functionality \ and \ interactivity}$ of the eye clinic information system.

* Additionally, there is an 'img' folder that stores the images used in the system's design.
